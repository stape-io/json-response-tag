# JSON Response tag for Google Tag Manager Server Side

## How to use JSON Response tag

JSON Response tag can be used for modifying the payloads of server-side responses. Here are some key points about what the JSON Response tag can do:

  1. Modify HTTP Responses: allows you to alter the contents of HTTP responses sent from your server-side GTM container to end users or to other systems. This can include changing, adding, or removing data in the JSON response.
  2. Customize Data: customize the data being returned in response to a server-side request. For example, you could use it to add additional information to a response or to format the data in a specific way.
  3. Control Data Flow: control the flow of data between your website and third-party services. By modifying the response data, you can ensure that only the necessary information is passed on, enhancing privacy and data security.
  4. Enhance Performance: optimize performance by modifying the size and structure of the response payloads, which can be particularly useful for mobile or low-bandwidth environments.
